Aim: Design Christmas LED chaser light.

Apparatus: Connecting Wires, Resistances, Arduino, LED.

Circuit Diagram:




Theory :

LED is a light emmiting diode that gives light as a output. It is a semiconductor. They require very less power to get lighted and work very efficiently.

Arduino:
An Arduino UNO is a device that is equipped with digital and analog input/output slots. It has 14 Input/Output slots, 5 Analog slots and can work between 7 to 20 volts.It has 3 ground pins. It works when user inputs code into arduino. 


Concept Used :

 One leg of  each LED is inserted into the input/output pin of the arduino. The other leg is connected to the resistance and the resistance is connected to the ground slot of  the arduino .

Observation :
  Chasing of LED is observed after uploading the code.

Learning Outcomes:

    1. Learned how to make a LED chaser.
    2. How to code for multiple LED.
    3. How to make LED's glow in different sequence.

Problems :

    1. Connections of LED may not be connected properly.
    2. LED's may not be working.
    3. Code may be wrong
    4. Arduino is not working.

Troubleshooting:

    1. All connections should be checked properly.
    2. Arduino should be working.
    3. LED's that are in working conditions should be used.
    4. Right code must be used.

Precaution:

    1. Don't plug in an LED without a current limiting resistor. 
    2. Don't supply more than 9V unless proper knowledge.
    3. Check all the connections.
